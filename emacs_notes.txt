Tips:
SPC h SPC - general help and also list available layers
SPC h d m - show what modes are running and all the key bindings associated with a buffer
SPC h d K - show bindings for keymap (e.g. evil-window-map)
SPC h d b - inspect function at binding, search by escaping spaces: "SPC\ s\ p"
SPC p p - helm projectile switch project
SPC / - smart search (using ag)
SPC s a p - ag search
SPC * / SPC s P - project-wide ag word under cursor or visual selection
SPC f r - open recent file
<C-w> o - zoom/unzoom buffer
" is the default register (both d and y write to this)
0 is the yank register (only y writes to this)

Layouts:
SPC l

Projectile:
SPC p

Helm:
C-c ? - shows help while in a helm session

Check out helm-swoop:
- project wide search and replace? (https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/2311)

Built-in elisp manual:
eval-expression (info "elisp") or M-: (info "elisp")

Things to fix:
-  owen/helm-ag-project-root-region-or-symbol should automatically run Ag without prompting
   - good reference: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10147686/how-to-automatically-navigate-to-default-found-tag
- helm-etags-select should filter from results. Instead when you type it does some dumb ass thing.
- add "gag" operator
- add snippets (yasnippet)
- super slow performance on global commands
  - https://bitbucket.org/lyro/evil/issues/446/filter-lines-in-buffer-extremely-slow
  - https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/2rdvev/spacemacs_windows_poor_performance_on_global/
  - Solution: use emacs keep-lines and flush-lines
- * search on stub_experiment! works until quitting and then hitting 'n'
- add in 'm' text object for ruby methods
- gn doesn't seem to work (https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/issues/6636)
- jumpy scrolling with ctrl-f and ctrl-b
- jumping to tag on something like Neon::Core::Body tries to look for the whole of
Neon::Core::Body and can't find anything
- unbind CMD-w (deletes buffer)
- figure out how to increase font size globally (cmd =/- just modifies current buffer)
- an equivalent of targets.vim

Nice to have:
- async command to generate tags file

Debugged scss_lint:
:flycheck-verify-checker
- May be due to running the wrong ruby version:
SPC ! ruby -v
SPC ! which ruby

Related to shell environment not being set (using the wrong version of ruby)

Move to PATH stuff from .zshrc to .zshenv?
.zshrc is only for interactive shells and .zshenv is for both (?)

Although there are valid reasons to have different PATHs for interactive
vs. non-interactive:
